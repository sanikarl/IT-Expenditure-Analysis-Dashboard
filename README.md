# IT-Expenditure-Analysis-Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing IT expenditure across multiple business areas, regions, and cost categories using Power BI, with the primary goal of offering clear visibility into how actual IT costs compare against forecasted and planned budgets. It aims to help organizations understand spending patterns, identify cost inefficiencies, and determine whether various business units are overspending, underutilizing, or aligning accurately with approved budgets. The process begins with preparing and transforming the Excel-based dataset within Power BI, where fields are standardized for consistency, missing values in actual, forecast, or plan fields are addressed, and date and categorical fields are formatted to support accurate filtering and trend analysis. This ensures the dataset is clean and fully optimized for reporting.

After preparation, the project moves into detailed cost analysis, where calculations are performed to determine total spending for actual, forecast, and planned values across multiple IT areas. Variances such as actual vs. plan and forecast vs. plan are computed using DAX formulas to uncover deviations. These insights help identify overspending or cost savings across regions, departments, and cost element groups. Trend analysis further highlights how spending behaves over time, enabling stakeholders to understand seasonal patterns or recurring financial inefficiencies. The project includes a drilldown capability that allows users to explore cost distribution from a high-level summary down to specific IT sub-areas, helping identify which departments or regions contribute most to deviations. It also distinguishes spending across internal labor and shared services to clarify cost drivers.

To communicate these insights effectively, an interactive Power BI dashboard is created, featuring slicers for region, department, IT area, and month, enabling users to explore the data dynamically. KPI cards summarize key financial metrics such as total actual, forecast, and planned costs, along with their variances. Bar and column charts depict cost distribution and variance comparisons, while line charts display cost trends over time. Treemaps and pie charts present cost distribution by category, making it simpler to identify major contributors. With full cross-filtering enabled, the dashboard updates instantly based on user interactions, providing a comprehensive and intuitive analytical experience. Overall, this project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow—from data preparation to advanced analytics and dashboard development—showcasing how Power BI can transform raw financial records into meaningful insights that support strategic decision-making in IT budgeting and cost management.
